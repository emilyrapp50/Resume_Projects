This repo contains a few projects that demonstrate the skills I aquired during my 2023 UC Berkeley Cyber Security BootCamp

  1. BASH: Playing the role of an attacker, in this assignment I remotely accessed a victim's target machine, maintained access using a backdoor, and cracked sensitive passwords in the /etc directory.
  2. Network Fundamentals I: Used ping, nmap, nslookup, ARP, etc. to comlpete a network assessment.
  3. Network Fundamentals II: Playing the role of a "Network Jedi working for the resistance", restore the Resistance's core DNS infrastructure and verify that traffic is routing as expected.
  4. Network Security: Snort, Firewall rules, IDS, defense layers, cyber kill chain.
  5. Web Development: HTTP
  6. Penetration Test: Group project posing at ShadowSecurity LLC, completed a pen test against “MegaCorpOne”.
  7. SIEMS: Used splunk to create a monitoring solution in order to protect "Vandalay" from security attacks.
  8. Governance, Risk and Compliance: Assessing security culture
